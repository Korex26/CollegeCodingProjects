INDEX OF PROMPTS
- Problem prompt: Create a program that prompts a user to create a password. The program then checks if the password valid if it has the following: Starts with a capital letter. Contains at least one number. Contains at least one of the following special characters ?, _ , $, or !. At least 8 characters long. If the password is invalid, the user is prompted to enter another password. If the password is valid, the program will indicate to the user and quit. Example console window output is shown below.

- Problem prompt:The following table contains grades for different sections of a class. Each column is an assignment, and each row is a section. Row 1 is section 101, row 2 is section 102, and row 3 is section 103. 80 99 100 60 90 74 88. 100 88 75 70 61 55 89. 55 76 50 80 88 100 100. Write a program that will calculate the following: Average grade for each section. The number of As, Bs, Ds, and Fs in the entire class. None of the calculations cannot be hard coded. For example Avg1 = 80 + 99 + 100 + 60 + 90 + 74 + 88; (or any variation) will result in 0 credit for code 3. You must use an array(s) and looping structure for the calculations in code 3. You may choose to implement in multiple 1D arrays or a single 2D array. Example console window output is shown below.
